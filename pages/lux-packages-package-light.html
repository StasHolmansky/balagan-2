                  This morning your guide will pick you and your fellow
                  travellers up at the hotel. The first leg of the journey takes
                  you around the famous Golden Circle, a popular route
                  containing some of the best-known natural sites in Iceland.

                  site; the Geysir geothermal hot spring area and the powerful
                  Gullfoss waterfall.<br /><br />

                  The tour will also visit the geothermally-heated greenhouses

                  Today you will explore majestic waterfalls, black sand beaches
                  and learn about the unique geology of Iceland. You will start
                  with a visit to the Lava Centre, a one of a kind interactive
                  exhibition about Iceland’s volcanic activity, its frequent
                  earthquakes and how Iceland evolved over millions of years.
                  Next up is the fairy tale-like Seljalandsfoss waterfall, where
                  you can walk behind the icy cascade on a footpath.<br /><br />

                  Close by your guide will take you to Skógarfoss, an empressive
                  60-metre high waterfall located at the foot of a mountain
                  range, followed by a visit to the Skógar Folk Museum. The last
                  stop before continuing to your accommodation is at the black
                  sand volcanic beach near the village of Vík í Mýrdal. Here,
                  you will be able to see the spectacular rock arch and steep
                  cliffs of along with the Reynisdrangar basalt columns just off
                  the shore.<br /><br />

                  Next, you will travel to your carefully selected charming
                  boutique hotel, situated far from the city lights to give you
                  the best chance of seeing the northern lights. Enjoy dinner at
                  Magma Hotel with the group. Spend the night at the Magma
                  Hotel.

              <h3>Buy a small backpack/suitcase</h3>
              <p>
                By purchasing a small backpack (I like something around 35/40
                liters), you will be forced you to pack light and avoid carrying
                too much stuff. Humans have a natural tendency to want to fill
                space so if you pack light but have lots of extra room in your
                bag, you’ll end up going “well, I guess I can take more” and
                then regret it.
              </p>

              <h3>But take extra socks</h3>
              <p>
                You’ll lose a bunch to laundry gremlins, wear and tear, and
                hiking so packing extra will come in handy. I only take a few
                more than I need. Nothing beats a fresh pair of socks!
              </p>

              <h3>Take an extra bank card and credit card with you</h3>
              <p>
                Disasters happen. It’s always good to have a backup in case you
                get robbed or lose a card. You don’t want to be stuck somewhere
                new without access to your funds. I once had a card duplicated
                and a freeze put on it. I couldn’t use it for the rest of my
                trip. I was very happy I had an extra and not like my friend,
                who didn’t and was forced to borrow money from me all the time!

          <h2>Cancellation policy</h2>
          <div class="container">
            <p>
              You can cancel your purchase of a subscription service and request
              a refund within 14 days from the initial transaction date.
            </p>
            <p>
              The refund may be reduced pro-rata to reflect the use you have had
              of the service. This may show as two transactions in your account
              transaction history: a refund to your wallet of the full amount
              originally paid and then a debit of a charge for the period of the
              service you received.
              <br />
              <br />

              If you take advantage of a free trial when you sign up to a
              service, the 14-day cancellation period will commence on the day
              we accept your order of the free trial and the duration of the
              free trial will be included in the 14-day period. For example, you
              sign up for a free trial which lasts 7 days and your wallet is
              debited for the subscription at the end of the trial, you will
              have 7 days after your wallet was debited to cancel.
              <br />
              <br />

              Note: When you purchase a subscription service such as
              PlayStation®Plus, you agree to a rolling subscription with
              periodic billing (e.g. annual billing). You can stop making
              payments at any time by turning off [Auto-renewal] (click here for
              more information) but, beyond the initial 14-day cancellation
              period, you will not receive a refund for payments already made.
              When you turn off [Auto-renewal], your subscription will continue
              until the next payment is due, at which point it will end.
            </p>
            <h3>Further Information</h3>
            <p>
              We recommend that you take care when you top up your wallet or
              make a purchase on PlayStation™Store. A number of account features
              are available so you can keep track of your account activity.
              <br />
              <br />
              To control the purchases made from the PlayStation™Store, via your
              account and console ensure you (i) use our password and passcode
              tools to control unauthorised log-in to and purchases via your
              account and (ii) if you have children, set up a separate account
              for each child and use our parental controls to limit their
              expenditure or prevent them shopping at all.
